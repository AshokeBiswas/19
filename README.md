Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?
Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization. It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function, which is the sum of squared residuals, to constrain the coefficients towards zero. This regularization technique helps prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.

Differences from other regression techniques:

Ridge Regression vs. Lasso Regression: Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which penalizes the sum of squared coefficients, while Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which penalizes the sum of absolute values of coefficients. This leads to different shrinkage behaviors:
Ridge tends to shrink coefficients towards zero but rarely exactly to zero.
Lasso can shrink coefficients all the way to zero, effectively performing feature selection.
Linear Regression: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals without any regularization, making it prone to overfitting when the number of predictors (features) is large relative to the number of observations.
Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?
The main advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically perform variable selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. This leads to a simpler and more interpretable model by eliminating irrelevant features, reducing overfitting, and improving prediction accuracy.

Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?
Interpreting coefficients in Lasso Regression is straightforward:

Non-zero coefficients indicate the importance of the corresponding feature in predicting the target variable.
Zero coefficients indicate that the corresponding feature has been eliminated from the model due to regularization, implying it is deemed less relevant.
Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?
In Lasso Regression, the main tuning parameter is lambda (or alpha in some implementations), which controls the strength of regularization:

Lambda: Increasing lambda increases the regularization strength, leading to more coefficients being shrunk towards zero, thus increasing bias and reducing variance.
Alpha: It's the scaling factor applied to lambda.
Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?
Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique that applies regularization to linear models. However, for non-linear problems, you can use:

Polynomial Features: Transform the input features into higher-degree polynomial terms and then apply Lasso Regression.
Kernel Methods: Use kernel methods to project data into a higher-dimensional space where linear models may be more effective.
Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?
The main differences between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lie in their regularization techniques:

Penalty Type: Ridge uses L2 regularization (sum of squared coefficients), while Lasso uses L1 regularization (sum of absolute coefficients).
Shrinkage Behavior: Ridge shrinks coefficients towards zero, but rarely exactly to zero, whereas Lasso can shrink coefficients all the way to zero, performing feature selection.
Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?
Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity to some extent by shrinking coefficients towards zero. When there is multicollinearity (high correlation between predictor variables), Lasso tends to select one of the correlated variables and shrink the coefficients of the others towards zero. This helps in reducing the impact of multicollinearity on the model.

Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?
Choosing the optimal value of lambda (or alpha) in Lasso Regression typically involves:

Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance with different values of lambda.
Grid Search: Perform a grid search over a range of lambda values and select the one that gives the best model performance metrics (e.g., lowest mean squared error for regression problems).
By systematically evaluating performance metrics across different lambda values, you can determine the optimal regularization parameter that balances bias and variance in the model effectively.
